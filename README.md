# Doppleganger-Viewer
# This has been built as a single-page client-side website to view Patrick Amadon's full Dopplegänger collection
# This can be run from a user's computer and does not require a web server as it is all HTML/CSS/JS
# The code does currently require Ethers.js but it would be good to revisit a fully inclusive method for API calls
# Each user will need their own Alchemy API Key which can be obtained for free from www.alchemy.com
# Only the original Dopplegänger contract address has been validated and it is unknown of other collections will work as well
